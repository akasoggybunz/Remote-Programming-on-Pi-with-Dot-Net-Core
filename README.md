# Remote-Programming-on-Pi-with-Dot-Net-Core
Instructions and Code sets for Programming on a Raspberry Pi using Dot Net Core 3.1 and the IOT Nuget


## Prerequisites
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)

## SSH Key

## Prepare Pi
1. Download [Rasbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) I used Rasbian Buster Lite, you can pick which ever distro you prefer.
2. Use Etcher to Install Rasbian to SD Card.
3. Once Etcher is done. Create a new Text file name 'SSH' on the SD card.
4. Copy SSH Key over to SD card. 
    - Jump to Creating SSH KEY section if you need to know how/where SSH key is.
5. Put SD card in Pi and Turn on.
    - Make sure you have an interent connection to the Pi. For ease of use I am going to connect Pi to LAN.
    - Get IP of PI. I use FING Android APP to find the I.P. Address of PI.
6.
